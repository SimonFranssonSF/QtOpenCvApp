# QtOpenCvApp

Small app written in C++ using QT Creator and openCV3 library. Open an image and see various filters/operators in use when smoothing, blurring, and detecting edges images. Choose the wished for parameters to see the effects of changing them. Save the changed image if you'd like. There is also an info dialog available containing some information about the different filters.

The next step is to implement and explore the feature detector/descriptor algorithms.
